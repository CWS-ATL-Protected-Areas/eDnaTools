# eDNA Tools

## Description

This repository contains R functions used to analyze data derived from environmental DNA samples. Data is sourced form:
- a [Smith-Root environmental DNA sampler](https://www.smith-root.com/edna/edna-sampler), which records sampling parameters such as volume (L), pressure (PSI), flow rate (L/min), and produces a CSV file for each water sample;
- a digital [Survey123](https://survey123.arcgis.com/) form, collected in the field with an iPad, with site parameters such as pH, water temperature, substrate type, ecosystem type; 
- the laboratory's bioinformatic pipeline, i.e., variables suc as DNA yield and numbers of DNA reads per taxon.
