	abstract = {It is well established that nonnative species are a key driver of global environmental change, but much less is known about the underlying drivers of nonnative species outbreaks themselves. In the present article, we explore the concept and implications of nonnative sleeper populations in invasion dynamics. Such populations persist at low abundance for years or even decades—a period during which they often go undetected and have negligible impact—until they are triggered by an environmental factor to become highly abundant and disruptive. Population irruptions are commonly misinterpreted as a recent arrival of the nonnative species, but sleeper populations belie a more complex history of inconspicuous occurrence followed by an abrupt shift in abundance and ecological impact. In the present article, we identify mechanisms that can trigger their irruption, and the implications for invasive species risk assessment and management.},

	abstract = {Abstract Terrestrial animals must have frequent contact with water to survive, implying that environmental DNA (eDNA) originating from those animals should be detectable from places containing water in terrestrial ecosystems. Aiming to detect the presence of terrestrial mammals using forest water samples, we applied a set of universal PCR primers (MiMammal, a modified version of fish universal primers) for metabarcoding mammalian eDNA. The versatility of MiMammal primers was tested in silico and by amplifying DNAs extracted from tissues. The results suggested that MiMammal primers are capable of amplifying and distinguishing a diverse group of mammalian species. In addition, analyses of water samples from zoo cages of mammals with known species composition suggested that MiMammal primers could successfully detect mammalian species from water samples in the field. Then, we performed an experiment to detect mammals from natural ecosystems by collecting five 500-ml water samples from ponds in two cool-temperate forests in Hokkaido, northern Japan. MiMammal amplicon libraries were constructed using eDNA extracted from water samples, and sequences generated by Illumina MiSeq were subjected to data processing and taxonomic assignment. We thereby detected multiple species of mammals common to the sampling areas, including deer (Cervus nippon), mouse (Mus musculus), vole (Myodes rufocanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), rat (Rattus norvegicus) and shrew (Sorex unguiculatus). Many previous applications of the eDNA metabarcoding approach have been limited to aquatic/semiaquatic systems, but the results presented here show that the approach is also promising even for forest mammal biodiversity surveys.},

	abstract = {We describe a novel method to detect a rare, secretive marsh bird using environmental DNA (eDNA). The black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) occurs in visually concealing habitats and is most commonly surveyed by auditory callback. This method does not detect unresponsive individuals, is constrained seasonally and temporally, and requires significant personnel effort. New minimally invasive detection methods are needed to determine distribution and habitat use of this threatened species. We developed a highly species-specific quantitative PCR assay. We conducted callback surveys targeting black rails at sites on the mid-Atlantic coastal plain to collect samples for validation of eDNA diagnostics. Our assay reliably produced a signal when sufficient copies of black rail template were present. We successfully amplified black rail eDNA from 47\% of the environmental samples taken from locations with detections. We tested whether environmental factors (water depth, salinity, air temperature), or sampling and handling procedures (time between collection and DNA extraction, storage temperature before filtering, field detection method, time between detection and sample collection) affected eDNA detectability. Only water depth had a significant positive effect on amplification success, emphasizing the importance of small pools as reservoirs of eDNA for terrestrial vertebrates. Our technique can be used in combination with other conservation strategies such as measuring occupancy in conjunction with habitat restoration efforts and resurveying coastal marshes after extreme weather events. It is adaptable to other elusive species of concern.},

	abstract = {The continuous decline in Earth’s biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity – especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) – defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material – is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.},

We developed a test for detecting the endangered Gouldian finch \textit{Erythrura gouldiae}, a small bird endemic to northern Australia. Only 1 previous study has reported an environmental DNA (eDNA) test that unequivocally identifies a bird species using the water bodies from which they drink. In controlled aviary trials with a pair of Gouldian finches, first detection in 200 ml of water occurred after as little as 6 h, but the detection rate was higher at 30 h. DNA persisted in water exposed to the sun for {\textless}12 h and in the shade for 12 h. In trials with 55 finches, persistence was up to 144 h. The eDNA test for finches and the Gouldian finch-specific test were positive for waterholes where Gouldian and other finch species were observed each morning over 3 d. Importantly, where no Gouldian finches were observed for up to 72 h prior to water sampling, the Gouldian test was negative. Where other species of finch but no Gouldian finch were observed and counted, the finch test was positive, but the Gouldian finch test was negative. This approach could be developed for broad-scale monitoring of this endangered species, and potentially applied to a much broader range of terrestrial species that shed DNA into water bodies.},

	abstract = {Abstract Species monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful new technique for natural resource scientists and the number of research groups employing eDNA detection is growing rapidly. However, current eDNA sampling technologies consist mainly of do-it-yourself solutions, and the lack of purpose-built sampling equipment is limiting the efficiency and standardization of eDNA studies. Here, we describe the first fully integrated sampling system (Smith-Root eDNA Sampler) designed by a team of molecular ecologists and engineers for high-throughput eDNA sample collection. It consists of a backpack portable pump that integrates sensor feedback, a pole extension with remote pump controller, custom-made filter housings in single-use packets for each sampling site and onboard sample storage. The system is optimized for sampling speed and replicability, while minimizing risk of contamination. We present an example pilot study designed to identify optimal eDNA Sampler system parameter values (i.e. pump pressure, flow rate, filter pore size, sample volume) in a new sampling environment. We identified a peak in filtration efficiency at a flow rate threshold of 1.0 L/m, and found that 5 ?m filters captured significantly more target eDNA than 1 ?m filters. Results also suggest that high filtration pressures may reduce eDNA retention, which implies that pressure should be standardized to avoid biasing detection data. Similar to the technological evolution of backpack electrofishers, eDNA sampling technology is in the process of transitioning from a nascent phase to professionally engineered research tools. Such innovations will be essential as eDNA monitoring becomes one of the industry standard methods used for species detection and management.},

	abstract = {Summary The past 100 years of ecological research has seen substantial progress in understanding the natural world and likely effects of change, whether natural or anthropogenic. Traditional ecological approaches underpin such advances, but would additionally benefit from recent developments in the sequence-based quantification of biodiversity from the fields of molecular ecology and genomics. By building on a long and rich history of molecular taxonomy and taking advantage of the new generation of DNA sequencing technologies, we are gaining previously impossible insights into alpha and beta diversity from all domains of life, irrespective of body size. While a number of complementary reviews are available in specialist journals, our aim here is to succinctly describe the different technologies available within the omics toolbox and showcase the opportunities available to contemporary ecologists to advance our understanding of biodiversity and its potential roles in ecosystems. Starting in the field, we walk the reader through sampling and preservation of genomic material, including typical taxonomy marker genes used for species identification. Moving on to the laboratory, we cover nucleic acid extraction approaches and highlight the principal features of using marker gene assessment, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, single-cell genomics and targeted genome sequencing as complementary approaches to assess the taxonomic and functional characteristics of biodiversity. We additionally provide clear guidance on the forms of DNA found in the environmental samples (e.g. environmental vs. ancient DNA) and highlight a selection of case studies, including the investigation of trophic relationships/food webs. Given the maturity of sequence-based identification of prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes, more exposure is given to macrobial communities. We additionally illustrate current approaches to genomic data analysis and highlight the exciting prospects of the publicly available data underpinning published sequence-based studies. Given that ecology ?has to count?, we identify the impact that molecular genetic analyses have had on stakeholders and end-users and predict future developments for the fields of biomonitoring. Furthermore, we conclude by highlighting future opportunities in the field of systems ecology afforded by effective engagement between the fields of traditional and molecular ecology.},

	abstract = {Abstract Non-indigenous species (NIS) reach every corner of the world, at times wreaking havoc on ecosystems and costing the global economy billions of dollars. A rapid and accurate biosurveillance tool tailored to a particular biogeographic region is needed to detect NIS when they are first introduced into an area as traditional detection methods are expensive and require specialized expertise. Metabarcoding of environmental and community DNA meets those biosurveillance requirements; a novel tool tailored to the Northwest Pacific Ocean is presented here using an approach that could revolutionize early detection of NIS. Eight newly designed genetic markers for multiple gene regions were implemented to meet the stringent taxonomic requirements for the detection of NIS across four major marine phyla. The tool was considered highly successful because it identified 12 known NIS in the study area and a further seven species representing potential new records. Overall community composition detected here was statistically different between substrate types; zooplankton sampling accounted for significantly higher species richness than filtered sea water in most cases, but this was dominated by mollusk and arthropod species. Both substrate types sampled were required to identify the wide taxonomic breadth of known NIS in the study area. Intensive sampling is known to be paramount for the detection of rare species, including new incursions of NIS, thus it is recommended to include diverse DNA sampling protocols based on species? life-history characteristics for broad detection capacity. Application of a metabarcoding-based molecular biosurveillance tool optimized for biogeographic regions enables rapid and accurate early detection across a wide taxonomic range to allow quick implementation of eradication or control efforts and potentially mitigate some of the devastating effects of NIS worldwide.},

While there are numerous reviews of molecular methods and bioinformatic steps, there has been little consideration of the methods used to collect samples upon which these later steps are based. This represents a critical knowledge gap, as methodologically sound field sampling is the foundation for subsequent analyses. We reviewed field sampling methods used for metabarcoding studies of both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem biodiversity over a nearly three-year period (n = 75). We found that 95\% (n = 71) of these studies used subjective sampling methods and inappropriate field methods and/or failed to provide critical methodological information. It would be possible for researchers to replicate only 5\% of the metabarcoding studies in our sample, a poorer level of reproducibility than for ecological studies in general. Our findings suggest greater attention to field sampling methods, and reporting is necessary in eDNA-based studies of biodiversity to ensure robust outcomes and future reproducibility. Methods must be fully and accurately reported, and protocols developed that minimize subjectivity. Standardization of sampling protocols would be one way to help to improve reproducibility and have additional benefits in allowing compilation and comparison of data from across studies.},

Here, we argue that two recent technological developments remove the need for haphazard sampling in many situations. A general approach to simple randomised sampling designs is outlined, and some examples demonstrate that even complicated designs can be implemented easily using software that is widely used among ecologists.

	abstract = {Abstract Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has revolutionized biomonitoring in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. However, for semi-aquatic and terrestrial animals, the application of this technique remains relatively untested. We first assess the efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding in detecting semi-aquatic and terrestrial mammals in natural lotic ecosystems in the UK by comparing sequence data recovered from water and sediment samples to the mammalian communities expected from historical data. Secondly, using occupancy modelling we compared the detection efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding to multiple conventional non-invasive survey methods (latrine surveys and camera trapping). eDNA metabarcoding detected a large proportion of the expected mammalian community within each area. Common species in the areas were detected at the majority of sites. Several key species of conservation concern in the UK were detected by eDNA sampling in areas where authenticated records do not currently exist, but potential false positives were also identified. Water-based eDNA metabarcoding provided comparable results to conventional survey methods in per unit of survey effort for three species (water vole, field vole and red deer) using occupancy models. The comparison between survey ?effort? to reach a detection probability of ≥.95 revealed that 3?6 water replicates would be equivalent to 3?5 latrine surveys and 5?30 weeks of single camera deployment, depending on the species. Synthesis and applications. eDNA metabarcoding can be used to generate an initial ?distribution map? of mammalian diversity at the landscape level. If conducted during times of peak abundance, carefully chosen sampling points along multiple river courses provide a reliable snapshot of the species that are present in a catchment area. In order to fully capture solitary, rare and invasive species, we would currently recommend the use of eDNA metabarcoding alongside other non-invasive surveying methods (i.e. camera traps) to maximize monitoring efforts.},

We surveyed natural ponds (N = 6) where focal species were present using stratified water sampling, camera traps, and field signs. eDNA samples were metabarcoded using vertebrate-specific primers. All focal species were detected in captivity. eDNA signal strength did not differ between directed and stratified samples across or within species, between semi-aquatic or terrestrial species, or according to behaviours. eDNA was evenly distributed in artificial waterbodies, but unevenly distributed in natural ponds. Survey methods deployed at natural ponds shared three species detections. Metabarcoding missed badger and red fox recorded by cameras and field signs, but detected small mammals these tools overlooked, e.g. water vole. Terrestrial mammal eDNA signals were weaker and detected less frequently than semi-aquatic mammal eDNA signals. eDNA metabarcoding could enhance mammal monitoring through large-scale, multi-species distribution assessment for priority and difficult to survey species, and provide early indication of range expansions or contractions. However, eDNA surveys need high spatiotemporal resolution and metabarcoding biases require further investigation before routine implementation.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Effective natural resources management requires accurate information about species distributions. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a commonly used method to determine species presence and distribution. However, when understanding eDNA-based distribution data, managers must contend with imperfect detection in collection samples and subsamples (i.e., molecular analyses) impacting their ability to detect species and estimate occurrence. Occurrence models can estimate 3 probabilities: occurrence, capture, and eDNA detection. However, most occurrence models do not. To quantify imperfect detection in rare versus common species, we examined multiple field capture and detection probabilities. We studied this with 3 objectives: Determine sample sizes required to detect eDNA given imperfect detection, determine sample sizes required to estimate eDNA capture parameters, and examine performance of a 3-level occurrence model. We found detecting eDNA in ≥1 sample at a site required ≤15 samples per site for common species, but detecting eDNA when looking for rare species required 45 to 90 samples per site. Our occurrence model recovered known parameters unless capture and detection probabilities were {\textless}0.2 where {\textgreater}100 samples per site and ≥8 molecular replicates were required. Our findings illustrate the importance of sample size and molecular replication for eDNA-based work. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:760?771. Published 2019.

	abstract = {The detection of rare macroorganisms using environmental DNA (eDNA) is a powerful new method for conservation and management; the efficacy of this method is affected by physiological, ecological, and hydrological processes. Understanding the processes limiting eDNA detection and accounting for those factors with optimized sampling designs is critical for realizing the potential of this tool. Amphibians are a focus of conservation programs globally and are often difficult to detect, presenting a challenge for effective action. To increase the ability of eDNA techniques to inform conservation and management programs, we investigated the eDNA detection of amphibians compared with field surveys for six species across a gradient of environmental factors expected to affect eDNA detection in three different systems: perennial wetlands, intermittent wetlands, and acidic intermittent wetlands. We applied a baseline sampling design in each wetland and used an occupancy modeling approach to evaluate evidence for processes limiting detection for each species given the presence of the target species. Evidence weights indicated that limiting processes varied across systems and included those associated with increased degradation (pH{\textless}5, temperature{\textgreater}25°C) and limited dispersion (wetland area{\textgreater}1200m2, sample volume{\textless}200mL). Optimized sampling protocols based on model results included an increased number of sampling locations in large and highly degradative (acidic) wetlands and increased filter pore size in high-particulate systems. These improved designs compensated for the previously limiting factors and yielded average detection rates of 0.62–0.86 per water sample. Degradation and dispersion processes appear to strongly influence the detection of amphibians in wetlands. Optimized, adaptive sampling designs can greatly increase the efficacy of eDNA monitoring approaches.},

	abstract = {Abstract Organisms continuously release DNA into their environments via shed cells, excreta, gametes and decaying material. Analysis of this ?environmental DNA? (eDNA) is revolutionizing biodiversity monitoring. eDNA outperforms many established survey methods for targeted detection of single species, but few studies have investigated how well eDNA reflects whole communities of organisms in natural environments. We investigated whether eDNA can recover accurate qualitative and quantitative information about fish communities in large lakes, by comparison to the most comprehensive long-term gill-net data set available in the UK. Seventy-eight 2L water samples were collected along depth profile transects, gill-net sites and from the shoreline in three large, deep lakes (Windermere, Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwent Water) in the English Lake District. Water samples were assayed by eDNA metabarcoding of the mitochondrial 12S and cytochrome b regions. Fourteen of the 16 species historically recorded in Windermere were detected using eDNA, compared to four species in the most recent gill-net survey, demonstrating eDNA is extremely sensitive for detecting species. A key question for biodiversity monitoring is whether eDNA can accurately estimate abundance. To test this, we used the number of sequence reads per species and the proportion of sampling sites in which a species was detected with eDNA (i.e. site occupancy) as proxies for abundance. eDNA abundance data consistently correlated with rank abundance estimates from established surveys. These results demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding can describe fish communities in large lakes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and has great potential as a complementary tool to established monitoring methods.},

	abstract = {Summary Species detection using environmental DNA (eDNA) has tremendous potential for contributing to the understanding of the ecology and conservation of aquatic species. Detecting species using eDNA methods, rather than directly sampling the organisms, can reduce impacts on sensitive species and increase the power of field surveys for rare and elusive species. The sensitivity of eDNA methods, however, requires a heightened awareness and attention to quality assurance and quality control protocols. Additionally, the interpretation of eDNA data demands careful consideration of multiple factors. As eDNA methods have grown in application, diverse approaches have been implemented to address these issues. With interest in eDNA continuing to expand, supportive guidelines for undertaking eDNA studies are greatly needed. Environmental DNA researchers from around the world have collaborated to produce this set of guidelines and considerations for implementing eDNA methods to detect aquatic macroorganisms. Critical considerations for study design include preventing contamination in the field and the laboratory, choosing appropriate sample analysis methods, validating assays, testing for sample inhibition and following minimum reporting guidelines. Critical considerations for inference include temporal and spatial processes, limits of correlation of eDNA with abundance, uncertainty of positive and negative results, and potential sources of allochthonous DNA. We present a synthesis of knowledge at this stage for application of this new and powerful detection method.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems worldwide are under threat with many fish species and populations suffering from human over-exploitation. This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate the potential of using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from ½-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species. Records in national databases confirmed the occurrence of all detected species. To investigate the efficiency of the eDNA approach, we compared its performance with 9 methods conventionally used in marine fish surveys. Promisingly, eDNA covered the fish diversity better than or equal to any of the applied conventional methods. Our study demonstrates that even small samples of seawater contain eDNA from a wide range of local fish species. Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100-bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-of-concept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources.},

Aims Here, we validate this potential in a large-scale analysis of vertebrate community data generated by eDNA metabarcoding of 532 UK ponds. Materials \& Methods We test biotic associations between the threatened great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) and other vertebrates as well as abiotic factors influencing T. cristatus detection at the pondscape. Furthermore, we test the status of T. cristatus as an umbrella species for pond conservation by assessing whether vertebrate species richness is greater in ponds with T. cristatus and higher T. cristatus Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) scores. Results Triturus cristatus detection was positively correlated with amphibian and waterfowl species richness. Specifically, T. cristatus was positively associated with smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), common coot (Fulica atra), and common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), but negatively associated with common toad (Bufo bufo). Triturus cristatus detection did not significantly decrease as fish species richness increased, but negative associations with common carp (Cyprinus carpio), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) were identified. Triturus cristatus detection was negatively correlated with mammal species richness, and T. cristatus was negatively associated with gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Triturus cristatus detection was negatively correlated with larger pond area, presence of inflow, and higher percentage of shading, but positively correlated with HSI score, supporting its application to T. cristatus survey. Vertebrate species richness was significantly higher in T. cristatus ponds and broadly increased as T. cristatus HSI scores increased. Discussion We reaffirm reported associations (e.g., T. cristatus preference for smaller ponds) but also provide novel insights, including a negative effect of pond inflow on T. cristatus. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate the prospects of eDNA metabarcoding for ecological hypothesis generation and testing at landscape scale, and dramatic enhancement of freshwater conservation, management, monitoring, and research.},

	abstract = {Invasive feral swine can damage ecosystems, disrupt plant and animal populations, and transmit diseases. Monitoring of feral swine populations requires expensive and labor-intensive techniques such as aerial surveys, field surveys for sign, trail cameras, and verifying landowner reports. Environmental DNA (eDNA) provides an alternative method for locating feral swine. To aid in detection of this harmful invasive species, a novel assay was developed incorporating molecular methods. From August 2017 to April 2018, water samples and stream data were collected along 400 m transects in two different stream types where swine DNA was artificially introduced to investigate potential factors affecting detection. A generalized linear model (family binomial) was used to characterize environmental conditions affecting swine DNA detection; detection was the dependent variable and stream measurements included stream type, distance downstream, water temperature, velocity, turbidity, discharge, and pH as independent variables. Parameters from the generalized linear model were deemed significant if 95\% confidence intervals did not overlap 0. Detection probability for swine DNA negatively related to water temperature (β =  - 0.21, 95\% CI [-0.35 to -0.09]), with the highest detection probability (0.80) at 0 °C and lowest detection probability (0.05) at 17.9 °C water temperature. Results indicate that sampling for swine eDNA in free-flowing stream systems should occur at lower water temperatures to maximize detection probability. This study provides a foundation for further development of field and sampling techniques for utilizing eDNA as a viable alternative to monitoring a terrestrial invasive species in northern regions of the United States.},

Here, we utilize four sets of upland stream mesocosms, across an acid–base gradient, to assess the temporal and environmental degradation of multispecies eDNA. Sampling included water column and biofilm sampling over time with eDNA quantified using qPCR. Our findings show that the persistence of lotic multispecies eDNA, sampled from water and biofilm, decays to non-detectable levels within 2 days and that acidic environments accelerate the degradation process.

However, the state and fate of eDNA in natural environments is still poorly understood for many ecological systems. Here we assess the state and fate of eDNA derived from the water flea, Daphnia magna, using a full factorial mesocosm experiment. We measured the quantity and degradation of eDNA over a two month period across a range of filters differing in pore size (0, 0.2, 1 and 10 µm), which spans the range of eDNA source material including subcellular, cellular and tissue. We also used two primer sets targeting mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (18S) genomic regions. Our findings demonstrated that eDNA was most prevalent in the effluent water, but also reliably detected on the 0.2 μm filter, suggesting subcellular material is the predominate state of eDNA. Temporal eDNA quantity dynamics followed an exponential decay function over the course of 6-17 days, demonstrating a predictable decline in eDNA concentration. Nuclear eDNA was more abundant than mitochondrial eDNA, which may be a result of greater primer affinity, or indicate greater availability of nuclear eDNA gene targets in the environment. In contrast to two previous size-sorting experiments, which utilizing fish eDNA, our findings suggest that the state of invertebrate eDNA is much smaller than previously suspected. Overall, our data suggest that the detection of eDNA greatly depends on our knowledge of the state and fate of eDNA, which differ among species, and likely across environmental conditions.},

We compared biodiversity information recovered using an eDNA metabarcoding approach with data from a dense camera trap survey, as well as the sampling costs of both methods. Via the sampling of large volumes of water from the two largest streams that drained the study area, eDNA metabarcoding provided information on the presence and detection probabilities of 35 mammal taxa, 25\% more than camera traps and for half the cost.

	abstract = {The masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) occurs naturally on a number of small to large islands in Atlantic Canada, and 22 individuals were introduced into Newfoundland from New Brunswick in 1958. Genetic variation detected by protein electrophoresis of 34 presumptive gene loci was assayed in five island and three mainland populations from this region to compare rates of differentiation among the populations and to investigate genetic relationships among populations in the context of historical biogeographic events constructed from the geological literature. We found considerable differentiation among populations which can be attributed to different origins for the populations in the post-Wisconsin glacial phase, and to apparently rapid evolution in small isolated populations, especially for the small island of Bon Portage, Nova Scotia. Allele frequencies are more heterogeneous among the island populations and exhibit classic neutral behaviour in that rare allelles are absent and shifts in allele frequency occur to either side of mainland means. There is no correlation of allele frequencies with geographic proximity of populations as might be expected under selectively based clines, or, alternatively, under isolation by distance expected with a diffusive wave of colonization in the region. Instead, the genetic data are compatible with random drift of neutral alleles in populations of various efffective sizes isolated from each other by rising sea levels in the last 20?000 ? 5000 years. The considerable divergence that has occurred among the island populations (FST?=?0.238) may be indicative of incipient speciation or subspeciation. This subdivision does not appear to be founder-induced but is more likely the product of gradual drift in and interruption of homogenizing gene flow among relict populations that existed during the Pleistocene.},

Five replicates of 1 L water samples were taken per sampling site. Water filtration and eDNA extractions were performed on-site, while qPCR reactions were performed in the laboratory using species-specific assays.

Despite the low pH and PCR inhibitors in water samples, our results showed positive eDNA detections in almost all expected positive sites (except in one site for Blanding?s turtle). Detections of the target species were also observed at sites where their presence was previously unknown. Our study supports the advantage of eDNA to monitor species at low densities, revealing new distributions or recently invaded areas.

Among these ecosystems, coastal wetlands are key elements that serve as transition zones between marine and freshwater ecosystems and are today the target of many conservation and restoration efforts. In this sense, eDNA monitoring could provide a rapid and efficient tool for studying and generating baseline biodiversity information to guide coastal wetland management programs. Here, we test an eDNA metabarcoding assay as a tool to characterize vertebrate biodiversity in one of the largest coastal wetlands of Chile, the Rio Cruces Wetland, a Ramsar designated site since 1981. We sampled surface water from 49 sites along the entire wetland. Our eDNA approach detected 91genera of vertebrates including amphibians, fishes, mammals, and birds, as well as identified several cryptic, exotic, and endangered species. Our results also indicated that the spatial distribution of eDNA from different species is spatially structured despite the complex hydrodynamics inherent in this wetland due to the influence of daily tidal regimes. For amphibians and fishes, the number of taxa detected with eDNA was higher in the periphery of the wetland, and increased with proximity to the ocean, a pattern consistent with small-scale spatial sensitivity for some species and eDNA accumulation downstream for others. Birds and mammals showed somewhat more idiosyncratic distributions. Taken together, our results add to the growing body of evidence showing eDNA can serve as a rapid cost-effective tool to characterize vertebrate communities in protected coastal wetlands, where visual surveys are difficult and animal collections are often prohibited. The use of multiple primer sets is also recommended as it facilitates the detection of ephemeral terrestrial organisms and resident aquatic organisms that make use of these wetlands.},

	abstract = {Abstract Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding surveys enable rapid, noninvasive identification of taxa from trace samples with wide-ranging applications from characterizing local biodiversity to identifying food-web interactions. However, the technique is prone to error from two major sources: (a) contamination through foreign DNA entering the workflow, and (b) misidentification of DNA within the workflow. Both types of error have the potential to obscure true taxon presence or to increase taxonomic richness by incorrectly identifying taxa as present at sample sites, but multiple error sources can remain unaccounted for in metabarcoding studies. Here, we use data from an eDNA metabarcoding study designed to detect vertebrate species at waterholes in Australia's arid zone to illustrate where and how in the workflow errors can arise, and how to mitigate those errors. We detected the DNA of 36 taxa spanning 34 families, 19 orders and five vertebrate classes in water samples from waterholes, demonstrating the potential for eDNA metabarcoding surveys to provide rapid, noninvasive detection in remote locations, and to widely sample taxonomic diversity from aquatic through to terrestrial taxa. However, we initially identified 152 taxa in the samples, meaning there were many false positive detections. We identified the sources of these errors, allowing us to design a stepwise process to detect and remove error, and provide a template to minimize similar errors that are likely to arise in other metabarcoding studies. Our findings suggest eDNA metabarcoding surveys need to be carefully conducted and screened for errors to ensure their accuracy.},

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis holds enormous potential for enhancing monitoring programs, but as this tool is increasingly adopted, it is imperative for users to understand its potential benefits and shortcomings. We conducted a comparative study to evaluate the efficacy of two eDNA methodologies (quantitative (q)PCR and metabarcoding) and conventional field sampling approaches (seining, dipnetting, and visual encounter surveys) in a system of 20 ponds containing six different amphibian species. Using an occupancy modeling framework, we estimated differences in detection sensitivity across methods, with a focus on how eDNA survey design could be further optimized. Overall, both metabarcoding and qPCR were competitive with or improved upon conventional methods. Specifically, qPCR (species-specific approach) was the most effective technique for detecting two rare species, the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii), with a detection probability of {\textgreater}0.80 per survey. Metabarcoding (community approach) estimated amphibian diversity with comparable rates to field techniques on average, and detected an additional 41 vertebrate taxa. However, for two abundant species (western toads, Anaxyrus boreas, and Pacific chorus frogs, Pseudacris regilla), field techniques outperformed metabarcoding, especially as individuals metamorphosed. Our results indicate that eDNA approaches would be most effective when paired with visual encounter surveys to detect terrestrial life stages, and that more optimization, specifically primer choice and validation, is needed. By comparing methods across a diverse set of ponds and species, we provide guidance for future studies integrating eDNA approaches into amphibian monitoring.},

	abstract = {Fast, reliable, and comprehensive biodiversity monitoring data are needed for environmental decision making and management. Recent work on fish environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding shows that aquatic diversity can be captured fast, reliably, and non-invasively at moderate costs. Because water in a catchment flows to the lowest point in the landscape, often a stream, it can collect traces of terrestrial species via surface or subsurface runoff along its way or when specimens come into direct contact with water (e.g., when drinking). Thus, fish eDNA metabarcoding data can provide information on fish but also on other vertebrate species that live in riparian habitats. This additional data may offer a much more comprehensive approach for assessing vertebrate diversity at no additional costs. Studies on how the sampling strategy affects species detection especially of stream-associated communities, however, are scarce. We therefore performed an analysis on the effects of biological replication on both fish as well as (semi-)terrestrial species detection. Along a 2 km stretch of the river Mulde (Germany), we collected 18 1-L water samples and analyzed the relation of detected species richness and quantity of biological replicates taken. We detected 58 vertebrate species, of which 25 were fish and lamprey, 18 mammals, and 15 birds, which account for 50\%, 22.2\%, and 7.4\% of all native species to the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt. However, while increasing the number of biological replicates resulted in only 24.8\% more detected fish and lamprey species, mammal, and bird species richness increased disproportionately by 68.9\% and 77.3\%, respectively. Contrary, PCR replicates showed little stochasticity. We thus emphasize to increase the number of biological replicates when the aim is to improve general species detections. This holds especially true when the focus is on rare aquatic taxa or on (semi-)terrestrial species, the so-called ‘bycatch’. As a clear advantage, this information can be obtained without any additional sampling or laboratory effort when the sampling strategy is chosen carefully. With the increased use of eDNA metabarcoding as part of national fish bioassessment and monitoring programs, the complimentary information provided on bycatch can be used for biodiversity monitoring and conservation on a much broader scale.},

However, considerable variation in data quality, rigor, and reliability has eroded confidence in eDNA application and is limiting regulatory and policy uptake. Substantial effort has gone into promoting transparency in reporting and deriving standardized frameworks and methods for eDNA field workflow components, but surprisingly little scrutiny has been given to the design and performance elements of targeted eDNA detection assays which, by far, have been most used in the scientific literature. There are several methods used for eDNA detection. The most accessible, cost-effective, and conducive to standards development is targeted real-time or quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (abbreviated as qPCR) eDNA analysis. The present perspective is meant to assist in the development and evaluation of qPCR-based eDNA assays. It evaluates six steps in the qPCR-based eDNA assay development and validation workflow identifying and addressing concerns pertaining to poor qPCR assay design and implementation; identifies the need for more fulsome mitochondrial genome sequence information for a broader range of species; and brings solutions toward best practices in forthcoming large-scale and worldwide eDNA applications, such as at-risk or invasive species assessments and site remediation monitoring.},

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) using probe-based chemistries may represent a particularly powerful tool because of the method’s sensitivity, specificity, and potential to quantify target DNA. However, there has been little work understanding the performance of these assays in the presence of closely related, sympatric taxa. If related species cause any cross-amplification or interference, false positives and negatives may be generated. These errors can be disastrous if false positives lead to overestimate the abundance of an endangered species or if false negatives prevent detection of an invasive species. In this study we test factors that influence the specificity and sensitivity of TaqMan MGB assays using co-occurring, closely related brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and bull trout (S. confluentus) as a case study. We found qPCR to be substantially more sensitive than traditional PCR, with a high probability of detection at concentrations as low as 0.5 target copies/µl. We also found that number and placement of base pair mismatches between the Taqman MGB assay and non-target templates was important to target specificity, and that specificity was most influenced by base pair mismatches in the primers, rather than in the probe. We found that insufficient specificity can result in both false positive and false negative results, particularly in the presence of abundant related species. Our results highlight the utility of qPCR as a highly sensitive eDNA tool, and underscore the importance of careful assay design.},

Here, we developed and tested a new quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect Atlantic sturgeon environmental DNA (eDNA) in water samples with the goal of providing an alternative method to monitor presence and relative abundance. We also examined Atlantic sturgeon eDNA shedding rates in laboratory experiments. A qPCR-probe assay targeting Cytochrome B was developed and showed no amplification of other related and co-occurring fishes. Pond trials at a density of {\textasciitilde}0.2 g/L sturgeon produced relatively strong eDNA detections ({\textasciitilde}1,000?25,000 copies/L) in all seven water samples assayed. Water samples taken from two river systems in the Chesapeake Bay produced zero eDNA detections in the summer, while fall sampling during sturgeon spawning produced positive eDNA detections in 26\% of samples, though at much lower concentrations (400?1,800 copies/L) compared with the pond (mesocosm) detections. Acoustic detections of sturgeon near river sampling sites were positively associated with eDNA detections. However, the eDNA assay failed to detect the presence of sturgeon in some samples when abundances were very low or when fish were in deep water. Finally, Atlantic sturgeon eDNA shedding rates were estimated to be on the order of estimates for other fish species, which suggests that relatively weak detections in the field are not necessarily driven by low rates of eDNA shedding. Overall, eDNA analysis represents a promising new monitoring tool for Atlantic sturgeon. Applying these methods in other rivers along the US east coast is an important next step in documenting Atlantic sturgeon distribution for management and conservation purposes.},

While biodiversity measured by morphology and by DNA often has been found correlated, few studies have compared DNA data to established measures of impairment such as multimetric pollution tolerance indices used by many bioassessment programs. We incorporated environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of seston into a rigorous watershed-scale biological assessment of an urban stream to examine the extent to which eDNA richness and diversity patterns were correlated with multimetric indices and ecological impairment status designations. We also evaluated different filtering approaches and taxonomic classifications to identify best practices for environmental assessments. Seston eDNA revealed a wide diversity of eukaryotic taxa but was dominated by diatoms (36\%). Differentiation among sites in alpha and beta diversity was greater when operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were classified taxonomically, but coarse resolution taxonomy (kingdom) was more informative than finer resolution taxonomy (family, genus). Correlations of DNA richness and diversity with multimetric indices for fish and macroinvertebrates were generally weak, possibly because Metazoa were not highly represented in our DNA dataset. Nonetheless, sites could be differentiated based on ecological impairment status, with more impaired sites having lower eDNA diversity as measured by the Shannon index, but higher taxonomic richness. Significant environmental drivers of community structure, as inferred from constrained ordination analyses, differed among kingdoms within the eDNA dataset, as well as from fish and macrobenthos, suggesting that eDNA provides novel environmental information. These results suggest that even a simple seston eDNA filtering protocol can provide biodiversity information of value to stream bioassessment programs. The approach bears further investigation as a potentially useful rapid assessment protocol to supplement more intensive field sampling efforts.},

DNA yields from different tissue types have seldom been compared, and the relative performance of storage media has never been directly tested, even though these media may influence DNA degradation under field conditions. We analyzed DNA yield from buccal swabs and wing punches harvested from live bats using nucleic acid quantification as well as quantitative PCR for a single-copy nuclear locus. We also compared DNA yields from wing tissue preserved in three media: ethanol, NaCl-saturated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and silica desiccant. Wing punches yielded more total DNA than did buccal swabs, and wing tissues preserved in silica beads yielded significantly more total and nuclear DNA than those preserved in DMSO or ethanol. These results show that tissue type and preservation media strongly influence the quantity of DNA obtained from non-lethal genetic samples, and based on these effects we provide recommendations for field collection of tissues for genetic analyses.},

	abstract = {Monitoring of biota is pivotal for the assessment and conservation of ecosystems. Environments worldwide are being continuously and increasingly exposed to multiple adverse impacts, and the accuracy and reliability of the biomonitoring tools that can be employed shape not only the present, but more importantly, the future of entire habitats. The analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding data provides a quick, affordable, and reliable molecular approach for biodiversity assessments. However, while extensively employed in aquatic and terrestrial surface environments, eDNA-based studies targeting subterranean ecosystems are still uncommon due to the lack of accessibility and the cryptic nature of these environments and their species. Recent advances in genetic and genomic analyses have established a promising framework for shedding new light on subterranean biodiversity and ecology. To address current knowledge and the future use of eDNA methods in groundwaters and caves, this review explores conceptual and technical aspects of the application and its potential in subterranean systems. We briefly introduce subterranean biota and describe the most used traditional sampling techniques. Next, eDNA characteristics, application, and limitations in the subsurface environment are outlined. Last, we provide suggestions on how to overcome caveats and delineate some of the research avenues that will likely shape this field in the near future. We advocate that eDNA analyses, when carefully conducted and ideally combined with conventional sampling techniques, will substantially increase understanding and enable crucial expansion of subterranean community characterisation. Given the importance of groundwater and cave ecosystems for nature and humans, eDNA can bring to the surface essential insights, such as study of ecosystem assemblages and rare species detection, which are critical for the preservation of life below, as well as above, the ground.},

	abstract = {Subterranean environments host a substantial amount of biodiversity, however assessing the distribution of species living underground is still extremely challenging. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a powerful tool to estimate biodiversity in poorly known environments and has excellent performance for soil organisms. Here, we tested 1) whether eDNA metabarcoding from cave soils/sediments allows to successfully detect springtails (Hexapoda: Collembola) and insects (Hexapoda: Insecta); 2) whether eDNA mostly represents autochthonous (cave-dwelling) organisms or it also incorporates information from species living in surface environments; 3) whether eDNA detection probability changes across taxa with different ecology. Environmental DNA metabarcoding analyses detected a large number of Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) for both insects and springtails. For springtails, detection probability was high, with a substantial proportion of hypogean species, suggesting that eDNA provides good information on the distribution of these organisms in caves. Conversely, for insects most of MOTUs represented taxa living outside caves, and the majority of them represented taxa/organisms living in freshwater environments (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera). The eDNA of freshwater insects was particularly abundant in deep sectors of caves, far from the entrance. Furthermore, average detection probability of insects was significantly lower than the one of springtails. This suggests that cave soils/sediments act as “conveyer belts of biodiversity information”, possibly because percolating water lead to the accumulation of eDNA of organisms living in nearby areas. Cave soils hold a complex mix of autochthonous and allochthonous eDNA. eDNA provided unprecedented information on the understudied subterranean cave organisms; analyses of detection probability and occupancy can help teasing apart local eDNA from the eDNA representing spatially-integrated biodiversity for whole landscape.},

	abstract = {Knowing the composition of animals present in aquatic ecosystems can tell us about the anthropic pressures on these environments. One of these pressures is the occurrence of fecal contamination. However, this contamination can originate from more than one animal species in areas where urban and agricultural activities overlap. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has become the standard barcoding tool to identify the presence of animal species in environment. Amplicon-sequencing metagenomics is a powerful approach to derive the animal profile in an environment. However, PCR primers targeting mtDNA of a broad range of animals are highly degenerate or generate short DNA fragments that could cause ambiguous affiliation. Here we report the development of a new set of primers targeting the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA genes of a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic animals, which include mammals, birds, and fishes. These primers successfully amplified mtDNA from environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from surface waters. Sequencing the resulting amplicons revealed the presence of mammals and birds that may contribute in fecal contamination of surface water. In one of the river samples high in fecal indicator bacteria, human and bovine mtDNA accounted for 40.5\% and 4.1\% of the sequences, respectively, suggesting fecal contamination by these two animals. These findings indicate that our PCR primers coupled with amplicon-sequencing metagenomics contribute in profiling the animal diversity in the surface waters and its surrounding. This approach could be a valuable tool to identify simultaneously the potential contribution of various animals as sources of fecal contamination in surface waters.},

Additionally, we assess the impact of two environmental variables (temperature and pH) on eDNA quantity. We surveyed 34 streams for three years, sampling four times each year. Four new populations were first identified with eDNA analysis, and then verified by field surveys. Our multi-year survey highlights that eDNA detection can be inconsistent over time, even in streams with known populations. There was no significant relationship between eDNA quantity and the environmental variables tested. Lastly, our results suggest that eDNA methods remain promising to estimate population size, since number of positive detections were positively correlated with population size in streams with known populations. We conclude that eDNA methods are powerful, but care must be taken when interpreting field results as they are affected by species ecology and environmental conditions.},

Here, we present a comprehensive literature review of studies applying metabarcoding technology to fish eDNA for the purpose of fish biodiversity monitoring. We systematically provide the available universal primers used to amplify barcoding sequences from fish eDNA, and then discuss reference barcoding databases, relevant bioinformatic analyses, as well as developed pipelines. The performances of universal primers and their relevant reference databases are summarized. Combined use of multiple primer pairs targeted for more than one gene marker (e.g., 12S, 16S, Cytb, COI), and use of both local and public databases are recommended as approaches to improve the sensitivity and reliability of fish eDNA analyses. We also compare the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding to traditional approaches for monitoring fish biodiversity and highlight challenges and future perspectives associated with this new tool. Ultimately, we advocate for greater incorporation of eDNA analysis into fish biodiversity assessments to assist environmental managers.},

	abstract = {The invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) imperils freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Effective management hinges on early detection of incipient invasions and subsequent rapid response, as established populations are extremely difficult to eradicate. Although environmental DNA (eDNA) detection methods provide a highly sensitive alternative to conventional surveillance techniques, extensive testing is imperative to generate reliable output. Here, we tested and compared the performance of two primer/probe assays to detect and quantify the abundance of bullfrogs in Western Europe in silico and in situ using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Although both assays proved to be equally target-specific and sensitive, one outperformed the other in ddPCR detection resolution (i.e., distinguishing groups of target-positive and target-negative droplets), and hence was selected for further analyses. Mesocosm experiments revealed that tadpole abundance and biomass explained 99\% of the variation in eDNA concentration. Because per individual eDNA emission rates did not differ significantly among tadpoles and juveniles, and adults mostly reside out of the water, eDNA concentration can be used as an approximation of local bullfrog abundance in natural populations. Seasonal eDNA patterns in three colonized ponds showed parallel fluctuations in bullfrog eDNA concentration. An increase in eDNA concentration was detected in spring, followed by a strong peak coinciding with the breeding season (August, September or October), and continuously low eDNA concentrations during winter. With this study, we report the validation process required for appropriately implementing eDNA barcoding analyses in lentic systems. We demonstrate that this technique can serve as a solid and reliable tool to detect the early stages of bullfrog invasions and to quantify temporal changes in abundance that will be useful in coordinating large-scale bullfrog eradication programs and evaluating their efficiency.},

Such studies often face difficulties in sample preservation if neither freezing facilities nor liquid nitrogen (LQN) are readily available. Thus, in order to prevent microbial community changes because of bacterial growth after sampling, preservation buffers need to be applied to samples. However, the amount of microbial community variation attributable to the different preservation treatments and potentially affecting biological interpretation is hardly known. Here, we sampled feces of 11 sheep (Ovis aries sp.) by using swabs and analyzed the effect of air-drying, an inexpensive self-made nucleic acid preservation buffer (NAP), DNA/RNA Shield™, and RNAlater®, each together with freezing (for 10 days) or storing at room temperature (for 10 days) prior to 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing to determine bacterial communities. Results revealed that the proportions of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to a bacterial phylum were affected by the preservation treatments, and that alpha diversities [observed OTUs, Shannon index, and phylogenetic diversity (PD)] were lower in all preservation treatments than in samples taken by forensic swabs and immediately frozen which is considered as the favored preservation treatment in the absence of any logistic constraints. Overall, NAP had better preservation qualities than RNAlater® and DNA/RNA Shield™ making this self-made buffer a valuable solution in wildlife microbiome studies.},

High-throughput sequencing (?HTS?) platforms now enable the rapid sequencing of DNA from diverse kinds of environmental samples (termed ?environmental DNA? or ?eDNA?).

Here, we review the use of eDNA metabarcoding for surveying animal and plant richness, and the challenges in using eDNA approaches to estimate relative abundance. We highlight eDNA applications in freshwater, marine and terrestrial environments, and in this broad context, we distill what is known about the ability of different eDNA sample types to approximate richness in space and across time. We provide guiding questions for study design and discuss the eDNA metabarcoding workflow with a focus on primers and library preparation methods. We additionally discuss important criteria for consideration of bioinformatic filtering of data sets, with recommendations for increasing transparency. Finally, looking to the future, we discuss emerging applications of eDNA metabarcoding in ecology, conservation, invasion biology, biomonitoring, and how eDNA metabarcoding can empower citizen science and biodiversity education.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) can be an effective tool for detecting low abundance invasive or imperiled species. However, many unknowns related to the physical, chemical and biological aspects of the target organisms and their environment hinder the successful application of eDNA to detect new invasive or imperiled species. Additionally, many eDNA methodological studies have been conducted in laboratory settings and may simplify our understanding of which variables are important to eDNA persistence and detection. Here we summarize our findings from recent methodological studies and present important factors to consider when planning eDNA studies. First, we examined how time to filtration (0-48 h after collection) and storage of water samples before filtration (open vs. chilled in the dark) influence eDNA copy number. We found that water samples kept in the dark and chilled had no significant loss of eDNA copy number relative to those filtered directly from the field, whereas water samples kept at room temperature and exposed to light had non-detections at {\textasciitilde}12 h. Next, we examined whether crayfish carcasses would produce detectable eDNA in a stream over 28 days. We found that carcasses never produced detectable eDNA, suggesting that for similar species and habitats, detections may indicate only live organisms. Then we assessed how stream flow, seasonality, and density of an invasive clam would impact eDNA copy number. Our results suggest that stream flow can dilute eDNA and result in non-detections, even when the target organism is abundant. In addition, we report a strong influence of seasonality on eDNA copy number and confirm previous findings that sampling during periods of biological activity results in greater probability of detection. Additionally, we found a positive relationship between the density of clams and eDNA copy number. Lastly, we will present preliminary results on whether eDNA can be used to successfully detect terrestrial salamanders.},

For the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) in the UK, the substantial cost and manpower requirements of traditional survey methods have hampered attempts to assess the status of the species. We tested whether eDNA could provide the basis for a national citizen science-based monitoring programme for great crested newts by (i) comparing the effectiveness of eDNA monitoring with torch counts, bottle trapping and egg searches and (ii) assessing the ability of volunteers to collect eDNA samples throughout the newt’s UK range. In 35 ponds visited four times through the breeding season, eDNA detected newts on 139 out of 140 visits, a 99.3\% detection rate. Bottle traps, torch counts and egg searches were significantly less effective, detecting newts 76\%, 75\% and 44\% of the time. eDNA was less successful at predicting newt abundance being positively, but weakly, correlated with counts of the number of newts. Volunteers successfully collected eDNA samples across the UK with 219 of 239 sites (91.3\%) correctly identified as supporting newts. 8.7\% of sites generated false negatives, either because of very small newt populations or practical difficulties in sample collection.
