The use of eDNA to assess remote coastal islands for the presence of
invasive terrestrial mammals

**Abstract**–Coastal islands face grave threats such as sea level rise,
development, and biological invasions. Yet, in many areas, basic
knowledge of the prevalence of island dwelling species and the pressures
that limit their persistence is often lacking. Biological inventories
can help fill these knowledge gaps and inform conversation actions, but
are hindered by the logistics and costs of conducting offshore or
nearshore fieldwork. In light of the need for environmental
practitioners to be able to survey islands robustly and efficiently, we
test off-the-shelf commercial environmental DNA water samplers and
commercial metabarcoding lab services as ways to enable rapid
inventories of coastal islands for mammalian biodiversity and invasive
terrestrial threats…

## Introduction

Using environmental DNA to detect the presence of terrestrial, aquatic,
or semi-aquatic organisms has been well established over the past decade
and a half (Ficetola, Miaud, Pompanon, & Taberlet, 2008; Harper et al.,
2019; Leempoel, Hebert, & Hadly, 2020; Lyet et al., 2021; Neice & McRae,
2021; Saenz-Agudelo et al., 2022; Sales et al., 2020). More recently,
there has been a massive increase in studies, by experts and non-experts
alike, that tout the potential of eDNA to transform conservation
projects through biodiversity monitoring. Indeed, eDNA methods appear to
offer conservation practitioners–who are often work within a
crisis-driven field and are faced with severe time and resource
constraints when it comes to acquiring ecological data–a revolutionary
tool; too often their is a lack of data and evidence underpinning
environmental management. But as citizen scientists, communities, and
practitioners from various backgrounds begin to foray into eDNA methods
(Biggs et al., 2015; Loeza-Quintana et al., 2021; Thomsen & Willerslev,
2015; Yang et al., 2021), it remains to be seen exactly how, where, and
when, this new tool can be utilized to inform long term conservation
management.

We sampled environmental DNA, extracted from water, to assess
terrestrial mammalian threats and a “biodiversity bonus,” on coastal
islands situated in a logistically challenging, ecologically threatened,
maritime landscape. Our study sites fall within an archipelago in the
province of Nova Scotia, Canada, which consists of some 4000 islands and
skerries, many of which are threatened by rising sea levels, biological
invasions, and human development. Such coastal landscapes in Atlantic
Canada have long relied on de facto conservation, due to in part to the
remoteness of islands. As conservation organizations and governments
move to prioritize the securement of new island landholdings, and boost
legal protection of existing island holdings, there is increased need
for rapid, cost-efficient assessment of island biodiversity and threats.
Thus, our objective is to test the use of eDNA as a tool to provide such
assessments, from the perspective of environmental practitioners in need
of system that combines ease-of-use, robustness, and quality assurance.
Specifically, we aimed to assess the diversity of problematic native and
invasive terrestrial mammals on islands, as a necessary first step of
implementation of a science-based conservation management and
decision-making, by providing detailed, on-the-ground assessments of
species and their threats (cite CS or others?).

How robust is the technology? Other applications? Some studies show a
correlation between the eDNA concentration and abundance (Everts et al.,
2021)

Alternative, direct methods of sampleing mammals include infrared
cameras, hair tunnels, cage and snap trapping, some of which require
intensive training, frequency checking, and extra levels of approvals
and permitting.

As conservation actions are largely based on fine-scale knowledge about
species distributions and their threats, we aim to: 1) conduct holistic
inventories of problematic mammal species in a key coastal islands that
haven not been recently evaluated, and 2) find ways to improve
monitoring of wildlife and their threats by deploying new detection
methods for invasive and problematic species through use of eDNA
methods. Our studies will help assess the ecological value of the
region, and inform decision makers involved in the transfer of lands for
inclusion within the protected areas network known as the Atlantic
Canada Archipelago.

Discussion–we believe knowledge generated from eDNA may help identify
and develop threat mitigation strategies and inform any future whole
island restoration efforts.

## Methods

We collected water samples from 35 sites on four islands (Seal, Mud,
Flat, and Boot) in Nova Scotia, Canada, during the fall of 2021. we
collected 30 water samples for eDNA analysis (nsamples in parentheses),
across Mud Island (2), Flat Island (2), Boot Island (5), and Seal Island
(26). We filtered distilled water in the same manner as the other field
samples, as a negative control. All samples were collected using a
Smith-Root backpack sampler and self-preserving 1.2 micron filters.
Samples were submitted to Precision Biomonitoring for analysis. Lab
analysis will employ MiMammal universal primers, primers that have
previously been shown to detect North American mammal species.

## Results

To date, reads (i.e., sequences of base pairs that correspond to part of
a DNA fragment) that correspond with 45 taxon have been detected from
the 35 water samples (collected from islands Mud, Flat, Seal, and Boot).
