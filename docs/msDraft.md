The use of eDNA to assess remote coastal islands for the presence of
invasive terrestrial mammals

### **Abstract**

Coastal islands face grave threats such as sea level rise, development,
and biological invasions. Yet, in many areas, basic knowledge of the
prevalence of island dwelling species and the pressures that limit their
persistence is often lacking. Biological inventories can help fill these
knowledge gaps and inform converation actions, but are hindered by the
logistics and costs of conducting offshore or nearshore fieldwork. In
light of the need for environmental practitioners to be able to survey
islands robustly and efficiently, we test off-the-shelf commmerical
environmental DNA water samplers and commerical metabarcoding lab
services as ways to enable rapid inventories of coastal islands for
mammalian biodiversity and invasive terrestrial threats.

To date, reads (i.e., sequences of base pairs that correspond to part of
a DNA fragment) that correspond with 45 taxon have been detected from
the 35 water samples (collected from islands Mud, Flat, Seal, and Boot).
